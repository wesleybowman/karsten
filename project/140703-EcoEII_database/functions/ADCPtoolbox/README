Hi Greg,

Very nice to meet you last week.

I wanted to follow up with a link to the Matlab characterization toolbox I've put together for processing and interpreting ADCP data:
http://depts.washington.edu/nnmrec/characterization.html

I've also attached a draft of a submitted paper that goes into a bit more detail on aspects of the characterization metrics.

Regards,

Brian
