    Looking at Plausible_Turbine_Locations.m, also asked Duane about
    software on the Acadia cluster, hoping to get git there.

    Began breakdown analysis of Plausible_turbine_locations, seeing what
    function calls are made, and going into those and seeing what is called

    Most seem reasonable, need to figure out about uTides.
